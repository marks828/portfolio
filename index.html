      <p class="about-p" id="p1">Before GA I was working as a substitute teacher while in graduate school for marriage and family therapy. After quickly realizing I would not make a good therapist, I tried to figure out what it was I wanted to do. I enjoyed teaching but wasn't sure I wanted to jump right back into traditional schooling. That's when a friend suggested that I look into coding.
      <br><br>
      He had me start by learning Python. Unfortunately that did not click with me. I am a creative person. I have played music for over 15 years and I worked as a freelance photographer after I graduated from college. That's when I found a love for HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I knew I found my love for coding in the creativity of web development.
      <br><br>
      I've gained a wide variety of coding skills, but I've also gained skills that are not exclusive to web development. With the help of my instructors, I've been pushed to learn more than I thought I could in a shorter amount of time than I thought possible. I have been equipped with the tools to step out into the professional development world and have confidence that I know I will succeed no matter where I go.
