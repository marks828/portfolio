      <p class="about-p" id="p1">I attended General Assembly in Washington D.C. in the fall of 2016 and have learned more about web development in the three months of the program than I thought I ever could have. I want to continue creating web sites for other people and help their business grow.
      <br><br>
      Ever since I can remember I have had the need to create. I was never great with draw so my creativity started with music and then bled over into photography. While I love playing music and taking photos, I never saw them as real careers. I became interested in web development in late 2015 and seriously pursued it in mid 2016. I was drawn to web development because it was another outlet to be creative.
      <br><br>
      I also have a need to help people. I want to have a positive impact on peopleâ€™s lives. I worked for an adoption agency during college and helped open adoption in Kenya. In college, I was the person friends would call at 3a.m. for a ride home. Through web development I could help create websites for others.</p>
